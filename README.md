## Overview

This repository contains data processing, analysis, and figure-generation code for the project **“Failing in retention, not recruitment: Gender differences in academic progression in psychology.”**

The project investigates gender differences in academic progression within the field of psychology, focusing on *when* gaps emerge and *where* retention shortfalls occur. Using large-scale bibliometric data, it examines academic age trajectories, publication performance, and cohort-based gender disparities.
